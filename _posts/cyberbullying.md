## Write Up

This analysis is based on the Media Production readings and Universal Principles of Design (further UPD). The narrative content, which is based on fundamental aspects of storytelling, is the first topic to be discussed. Then I will explain how I used several UPD and camera/video production techniques to create video in a visually appealing and interesting way.

The main character in the video is a teenager who is about to post a photo on Instagram. After preparing, she uploads a photo and after a while receives negative comments. 

I had to create this video not in the most suitable environment. So, I had to choose a topic on which I can shoot a good video (with my current situation in mind) without using stock footage. The topic of cyberbullying gave me an opportunity to shoot everything in my apartments.

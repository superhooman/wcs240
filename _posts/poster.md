title: 'Infographic Poster'
excerpt: 'An interesting place to see multimodal rhetoric and design at work is in the genre of an infographic. The multiple modes available for use in infographics give writers/designers a set of affordances with the potential to make information more appealing, accessible, and inviting to a larger audience by visually representing that information.'

## Write Up

The purpose of this poster is to convince the audience of the advantages Tesla has over conventional cars. I have selected facts from Tesla's "Impact Report" to display the most relevant information. I presented this information in the form of an infographic poster. To represent the data, I used different approaches. One of them is data presented as a graph. Another one is in the form of a flow diagram. I used **chunking** and **the common region principle** to divide the information into several logical parts. In addition to that, I added numbered headings to each chunk to create a flow between them and enhance **closure**. I tried to develop a small design system for this poster to improve **consistency**: typography, colors, margins, etc. In some places, I highlighted the word "Tesla" with blue color as a try to use the **focal point** principle.

The feedback that I received during our peer review was helpful. I changed several things, and I think now the poster looks better than the first draft. I changed the layout of some parts, added the bottom text as the conclusion of the whole poster, and added some additional information for **comparison**. Also, I changed the title and added a conclusion to the end of the poster, as was advised by my peers.

However, I am still not sure about some decisions that I made. For example, there is almost no whitespace, and the poster looks overloaded. This is the part that I was struggling with most. I noticed that posters of other students were in different formats and sizes. However, I thought that it was too late to change everything, so I stayed with an A4 format.

I liked the assignment, but I still think that it could be done better. I hope that this experience will help me in the future.

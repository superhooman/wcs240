## Write Up

This video is my take on digital narrative and video creation. I think that we had not so much time for better production, but I did everything possible in my situation. I got a lot of new experiences and I think that I changed my mind about storytelling and video production. It is not as simple as it seems and it requires a lot of work. I wish that we had more time to do everything as I think that the result is not perfect.

A big amount of shots in this video was from my archives. This was a huge limitation as I wasn't able to change compositions or actions in these shots.
